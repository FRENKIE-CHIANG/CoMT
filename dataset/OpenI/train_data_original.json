Chronic appearing deformity of the proximal right humerus, old right rib fractures, and verterbroplasty change near the thoracolumbar junction are also noted. Based on the findings, very small left pleural effusion and minimal bibasal subsegmental atelectasis/scar are detected."

The left lung depicts an opacity, which was not clear on the earlier exam, indicating a possible area of airspace disease. The left base opacities appear stable and could be due to scarring or atelectasis. No sign of pneumothorax is visible, but low lung volumes are noted. Additionally, the X-ray shows degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Considering the findings, the impression is suggestive of left midlung opacity that can be due to low-grade infection or an early neoplasm. It is suggested to follow up with appropriate diagnostic measures and interventions. The postsurgical changes and stable left base opacities indicate scarring or atelectasis."

Minimal streaky atelectasis is evident in the left lung base, but with no focal consolidation, suspicious pulmonary opacity, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Thoracic spondylosis is also observed. Overall, no acute process is found, and redemonstration of pulmonary fibrosis without acute infiltrate is present. The report mentions a stable left PICC with a tip lying over the mid SVC and large feeding tube courses below diaphragm. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are also present. Additionally, there is right upper and left lower lobe airspace disease present. The frontal and lateral views reveal a small right pleural effusion and right base fluid level possibly indicating atypical location for hiatal hernia or cavity. Stable pleural effusions and thickening, right worse than left and stable right apical thickening/atelectasis with volume loss suggests prior radiation or surgery. Clinical correlation is recommended to investigate the findings further."

The cardiovascular system also appears normal with clear pleural spaces, and spine showing only degenerative changes. There is an electronic cardiac device present overlying the left chest wall with intact distal leads in the right heart. The impression of the observation suggests that there is no acute cardiopulmonary disease; however, further tests such as chest fluoroscopy or CT scan would confirm the irregular shading in the left upper lung."

The lungs appear hypoinflated with central bronchovascular crowding but are clear of any focal airspace disease, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Additionally, there are no acute bony findings but there are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. It is noteworthy that the patient appears to be morbidly obese, which explains the accentuated low lung volumes and eventration of the anterior right hemidiaphragm. In conclusion, the x-ray does not show any acute abnormality, but further investigation is necessary to confirm suspected cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion."

The patient has a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in the right atrium. Additionally, there is no significant pulmonary edema, but there is low lung volumes. There is evidence of lower thoracic vertebral body deep opacities and multiple mild vertebral body wedge deformities in the mid thoracic spine. The patient also has moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and multiple bilateral rib fractures, most of which appear old. The impression is that the patient has moderate left basilar lung consolidation with mild right basilar opacities, which may represent infection and/or atelectasis. Overall, the patient has no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, but has multiple pre-existing conditions that require medical attention."
