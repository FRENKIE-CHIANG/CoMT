Overall, the results of the examination suggest an unremarkable chest X-ray with no acute disease."

This suggests several possible diagnoses, including uneven buildup of fluid in the lungs, inflammation, an unusual infection, or an infiltrative process. It is recommended to compare this exam with previous ones and to consult with a doctor to discuss the results. The fullness in the lung tissue around the airway branches may suggest high blood pressure in the lungs, and could be due to reactive lymph nodes or metastatic disease."
